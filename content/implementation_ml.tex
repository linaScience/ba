\section{Preprocessing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Preprocessing important step of ML
        \item Data is not consistent
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Wi-Fi and waypoint Data are not measured at the same time (some could be event triggered, but just speculation)
            \item First: Interpolate waypoints to the timestamps of Wi-Fi data
            \item Second: Merge interpolated waypoints and Wi-Fi Data
            \item Detected jumps in time and in position
            \item Present solutions: Split data into several parts, where the position more than 10 meters from the last position or time difference more than 60 minutes
            \item time difference of more than 60 minutes could also lead to a jump in position: Therefore, position more than 10 meters away
            \item
