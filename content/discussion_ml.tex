\section{Suitable machine learning algorithm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What do we want to predict?
        \item We want to use supervised learning
        \item We want to predict the 3 best bssids for a given location of a user
        \item We could use regression or classification
        \item Pro regression: We could predict the exact signal strength
        \item Con: bssids could not be compared and though predicted
        \item Pro classification: bssids could be compared and though predicted
    \end{itemize}
