% \begin{itemize}
%     \item What do we want to predict?
%     \item We want to use supervised learning
%     \item We want to predict the 3 best bssids for a given location of a user
%     \item We could use regression or classification
%     \item Pro regression: We could predict the exact signal strength
%     \item Con: bssids could not be compared and though predicted
%     \item Pro classification: bssids could be compared and though predicted
% \end{itemize}
