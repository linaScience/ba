\chapter{Suitable Machine Learning Algorithm}\label{sec:ml-algo}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item What do we want to predict?
%     \item We want to use supervised learning
%     \item We want to predict the 3 best bssids for a given location of a user
%     \item We could use regression or classification
%     \item Pro regression: We could predict the exact signal strength
%     \item Con: bssids could not be compared and though predicted
%     \item Pro classification: bssids could be compared and though predicted
% \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item As seen in previous chapter, we have a lot of data
    \item as this is a time series, we want to use a time series model
    \item as we want to predict the next BSSID out of many BSSIDs, so classification problem with supervised learning
    \item there are still many models
    \item which one is suitable for our problem?
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification Models}
\begin{itemize}
    \item prediction of next BSSID is a classification problem, we want to use a classification algorithm
    \item for multivariate time series classification models there are only a few models
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \acp{mlp} \cite{TSC}
        \item \acp{rnn} such as \acp{lstm}\cite{lstm-hochreiter} or \acp{gru}
        \item \acp{hmm} \cite{hmm-movement-prediction}, 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \acp{mlp} performance is worse than \acp{lstm} in stock predicitons\cite{comparison-lstm-mlp} 
\end{itemize}
