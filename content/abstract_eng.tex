\begin{itemize}
    % intro/background: what's problem?
    \item human movement not considered when roaming of mobile devices appears
    \item could lead to many unnecessary handovers and thus to bad performance
    \item this thesis proposes a machine learning-based approach to predict the \ac{ap} a user is nearest to, according to the \ac{rssi} of the \acp{ap}
    \item the machine learning model is based on \ac{lstm} and is trained on a real-world dataset from a competition by Microsoft Research
    \item many \acp{ap} are deployed in the buildings of the dataset, which makes the prediction task hard
    \item one building and one floor was chosen to be the dataset for this thesis
    \item the evaluation of the model shows that the model is able to predict the \ac{ap} a user is nearest to with a top 3 accuracy of about 71\%
    \item too many classes, which makes prediction too hard and top 3 accuracy too low
    \item with fewer classes, the model could predict better
\end{itemize}
