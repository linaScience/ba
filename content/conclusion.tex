\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
 
\ac{ap} prediction with user movement is a hard task with many classes.
Although \ac{lstm} is the best choice among the discussed models for this task, the prediction accuracy for selecting on of the top 3 \acp{ap} is XX\%.
In the future, the model could also be trained for other floors and sites, which would likely result in similar accuracies.

With fewer classes, the \ac{lstm} model could predict better, which could be a reason why \ac{ml} model prediction is only slightly better than the simpler heuristic approach.
Furthermore, the model could be enhanced with other sensor data such as gyroscope and magnetic field data.
Maybe the sliding window size is too small, and a larger window size could improve the prediction.
Also, one could generate data from mobile devices or \acp{ap}, so that more information such as location of the \ac{ap} and setup is known and can be used in prediction.
