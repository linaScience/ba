\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item indoor human movement prediction is a hard task with many classes
    \item although \ac{lstm} is the best choice for this task, the prediction accuracy is 70\%
    \item with lesser classes,\fmhkn{fewer... classes sind countable } model could predict better, which could be a reason why \ac{ml} model \fmhkn{I am still strugglling to see where the classes come from, why there is no freedom of rediefining them, ... }
    \item future work: use \ac{lstm} with fewer classes 
    \subitem or generate data from mobile devices, so complete setup is known
    \subitem or generate data from \acp{ap} to predict human movement 
    \subitem could than be integrated in \acs{ap} software like OpenWrt
\end{itemize}
