  abstract = {Recently, the topic of indoor outdoor detection (IOD) has seen its popularity increase, as IOD models can be leveraged to augment the performance of numerous Internet of Things and other applications. IOD aims at distinguishing in an efficient manner whether a user resides in an indoor or an outdoor environment, by inspecting the cellular phone sensor recordings. Legacy IOD models attempt to determine a user's environment by comparing the sensor measurements to some threshold values. However, as we also observe in our experiments, such models exhibit limited scalability, and their accuracy can be poor. Machine learning (ML)-based IOD models aim at removing this limitation, by utilizing a large volume of measurements to train ML algorithms to classify a user's environment. Yet, in most of the existing research, the temporal dimension of the problem is disregarded. In this article, we propose treating IOD as a multivariate time-series classification (TSC) problem, and we explore the performance of various deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate that a multivariate TSC approach can be used to monitor a user's environment, and predict changes in its state, with greater accuracy compared to conventional approaches that ignore the feature variation over time. Additionally, we introduce a new DL model for multivariate TSC, exploiting the concept of self-attention and atrous spatial pyramid pooling. The proposed DL multivariate TSC framework exploits only low power consumption sensors to infer a user's environment, and it outperforms state-of-the-art models, yielding a higher accuracy combined with a smaller computational cost.},

Student populations in campuses, pedestrian and vehicular movement in urban areas, etc have been studied by cell phone and mobility management researchers to address issues in quality of service (QoS), seamless session handoffs, etc. Access to information such as user movement times, direction, speed, etc provides an opportunity for networks to efficiently manage resources to satisfy user needs. Towards this goal, we propose a generic framework to approach the problem of mobility prediction using hidden Markov models (HMM). This method can be used to model hidden parameters in the models. We propose a way to extract user movement information from a real dataset, train a HMM using this data and make predictions using the HMM. This model can successfully predict long sequences of a mobile user's path from observed sequences and also uses successive sequences of observed data to train its learning parameters to enhance prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we show that this model is very generic and can be suited to make predictions using the same information from the perspective of the access point or the mobile node.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

We are fairly surrounded by a huge number of proactive applications, which automatically provide users with relevant information exactly at the right time and at the right place when they need it. This ability is generally given by the exploitation of context information, and mainly Location Information. However, a location service running onto a smartphone has to deal with a great challenge, which is to manage the trade-off between the service's resources usage and its accuracy. In my work I investigate efficient localization strategies: these include, in addition to the standard location tracking techniques, the support of other technologies already available on mobile phones (i.e., sensors), as well as the integration of either Human Mobility Modelling and Machine Learning techniques. The main purposes of this work are: to reduce the impact that the service has on the device's resources usage in the case of continuous localization; to preserve the privacy of the user by running the whole system on the mobile device without relying on a back-end server; and to offer an ubiquitous coverage.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, 16.7 million people die each year due to cardiovascular disease. These statistics raise demand of devices like sensor-based pacemakers (PM) which are not just doing heart rate augmentation but also capable to transmit information via wireless link to on body sensor and support remote monitoring of such patients. As per the world health organization WHO reports there are more than 3 million functioning PMs and about 600,000 pacemakers are implanted each year in world. On an average, 70–80\% of PMs are implanted in aged patients around 65 years or older. In addition to continuous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters, detection of physical movement of such patients may be helpful to assess their well-being. This paper has been formulated with an aim to highlight an approach which may be used to detect the physical movement of the patient using information signal received from implanted PM. The transmitted signal will experience a pathloss offered by wireless human body channel, which will affect the link quality parameters namely Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In the current work mathematical model has been formulated considering in body and on body channel propagation conditions and received power, received energy, pathloss, SNR, BER, bit rate, energy per bit and RSSI have been evaluated using IEEE802.15.6 channel models CM2 and CM3. Data set has been created and human body movement has been detected using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Prediction accuracy of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Random Forest have been compared. The analysis performed depicts that human body movement can be detected using different channel models and ML techniques such as MLP, kNN and Random Forest with an accuracy of 65.3\%, 72.8\% and 93.4\% respectively. The critical comparison of the result indicates that the performance of Random Forest is better than MLP and kNN. This approach will be helpful in remote detection of human body movement of patients.},

Due to the complex nature of the radio environment, analytical models may not characterize the wireless channel, which makes the solution of these problems very difficult. Recently, cognitive network architectures using sophisticated learning techniques are increasingly being applied to such problems. In this paper, we propose data-driven machine learning (ML) schemes to efficiently solve these problems in wireless LAN (WLAN) networks. The proposed schemes are evaluated and results are compared with traditional approaches to the aforementioned problems. The results report significant improvement in network performance by applying the proposed schemes. The proposed scheme for handover prediction outperforms traditional methods i.e. received signal strength method and traveling distance method by reducing the number of unnecessary handovers by 60\% and 50\% respectively. Similarly, in AP selection, the proposed scheme outperforms the strongest signal first and least loaded first algorithms by achieving higher throughput gains up to 9.2\% and 8\% respectively.},

	abstract = {IEEE802.11 Wireless LAN (WLAN) is being widely used in public space such as airport, and increases the networking boundary in campus and enterprise, and it has lastly attracted considerable attention for mesh network and converged network with other 3G mobile communication networks. In WLAN, load balancing among Access Points (AP) is an important issue for efficient resource management or supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) of traffic, but most researches focused on the AP selection in network entry or roaming of Stations (STA). In this paper, we propose an AP-Initiated Flow Redirection (FR) for AP load balancing by monitoring AP’s availability in the true sense. When the AP’s resource becomes almost saturated, that is used more than a specific threshold, the AP queries the roaming possible neighbor APs about their availability and calculates the distribution of traffic load with statistical methods such as entropy or chi-square.

	abstract = {In this article, we present a survey of recent advances in passive human behavior recognition in indoor areas using the channel state information (CSI) of commercial WiFi systems. The movement of the human body parts cause changes in the wireless signal reflections, which result in variations in the CSI. By analyzing the data streams of CSIs for different activities and comparing them against stored models, human behavior can be recognized. This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that are presented herein have great performance; however, instead of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networking (RNN) and show the improved performance. We also discuss different challenges such as environment change, frame rate selection, and the multi-user scenario; and finally suggest possible directions for future work.},

	abstract = {Wireless local area networks (WLANs) empowered by IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) hold a dominant position in providing Internet access thanks to their freedom of deployment and configuration as well as the existence of affordable and highly interoperable devices. The Wi-Fi community is currently deploying Wi-Fi 6 and developing Wi-Fi 7, which will bring higher data rates, better multi-user and multi-AP support, and, most importantly, improved configuration flexibility. These technical innovations, including the plethora of configuration parameters, are making next-generation WLANs exceedingly complex as the dependencies between parameters and their joint optimization usually have a non-linear impact on network performance. The complexity is further increased in the case of dense deployments and coexistence in shared bands. 
				While classical optimization approaches fail in such conditions, machine learning (ML) is able to handle complexity. Much research has been published on using ML to improve Wi-Fi performance and solutions are slowly being adopted in existing deployments. In this survey, we adopt a structured approach to describe the various Wi-Fi areas where ML is applied. To this end, we analyze over 250 papers in the field, providing readers with an overview of the main trends. Based on this review, we identify specific open challenges and provide general future research directions.},
