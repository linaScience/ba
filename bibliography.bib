  abstract = {Recently, the topic of indoor outdoor detection (IOD) has seen its popularity increase, as IOD models can be leveraged to augment the performance of numerous Internet of Things and other applications. IOD aims at distinguishing in an efficient manner whether a user resides in an indoor or an outdoor environment, by inspecting the cellular phone sensor recordings. Legacy IOD models attempt to determine a user's environment by comparing the sensor measurements to some threshold values. However, as we also observe in our experiments, such models exhibit limited scalability, and their accuracy can be poor. Machine learning (ML)-based IOD models aim at removing this limitation, by utilizing a large volume of measurements to train ML algorithms to classify a user's environment. Yet, in most of the existing research, the temporal dimension of the problem is disregarded. In this article, we propose treating IOD as a multivariate time-series classification (TSC) problem, and we explore the performance of various deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate that a multivariate TSC approach can be used to monitor a user's environment, and predict changes in its state, with greater accuracy compared to conventional approaches that ignore the feature variation over time. Additionally, we introduce a new DL model for multivariate TSC, exploiting the concept of self-attention and atrous spatial pyramid pooling. The proposed DL multivariate TSC framework exploits only low power consumption sensors to infer a user's environment, and it outperforms state-of-the-art models, yielding a higher accuracy combined with a smaller computational cost.},

Student populations in campuses, pedestrian and vehicular movement in urban areas, etc have been studied by cell phone and mobility management researchers to address issues in quality of service (QoS), seamless session handoffs, etc. Access to information such as user movement times, direction, speed, etc provides an opportunity for networks to efficiently manage resources to satisfy user needs. Towards this goal, we propose a generic framework to approach the problem of mobility prediction using hidden Markov models (HMM). This method can be used to model hidden parameters in the models. We propose a way to extract user movement information from a real dataset, train a HMM using this data and make predictions using the HMM. This model can successfully predict long sequences of a mobile user's path from observed sequences and also uses successive sequences of observed data to train its learning parameters to enhance prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we show that this model is very generic and can be suited to make predictions using the same information from the perspective of the access point or the mobile node.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

This ability is generally given by the exploitation of context information, and mainly Location Information. However, a location service running onto a smartphone has to deal with a great challenge, which is to manage the trade-off between the service's resources usage and its accuracy. In my work I investigate efficient localization strategies: these include, in addition to the standard location tracking techniques, the support of other technologies already available on mobile phones (i.e., sensors), as well as the integration of either Human Mobility Modelling and Machine Learning techniques. The main purposes of this work are: to reduce the impact that the service has on the device's resources usage in the case of continuous localization; to preserve the privacy of the user by running the whole system on the mobile device without relying on a back-end server; and to offer an ubiquitous coverage.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, 16.7 million people die each year due to cardiovascular disease. These statistics raise demand of devices like sensor-based pacemakers (PM) which are not just doing heart rate augmentation but also capable to transmit information via wireless link to on body sensor and support remote monitoring of such patients. As per the world health organization WHO reports there are more than 3 million functioning PMs and about 600,000 pacemakers are implanted each year in world. On an average, 70â80\% of PMs are implanted in aged patients around 65Â years or older. In addition to continuous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters, detection of physical movement of such patients may be helpful to assess their well-being. This paper has been formulated with an aim to highlight an approach which may be used to detect the physical movement of the patient using information signal received from implanted PM. The transmitted signal will experience a pathloss offered by wireless human body channel, which will affect the link quality parameters namely Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In the current work mathematical model has been formulated considering in body and on body channel propagation conditions and received power, received energy, pathloss, SNR, BER, bit rate, energy per bit and RSSI have been evaluated using IEEE802.15.6 channel models CM2 and CM3. Data set has been created and human body movement has been detected using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Prediction accuracy of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest NeighboursÂ (kNN) and Random Forest have been compared. The analysis performed depicts that human body movement can be detected using different channel models and ML techniques such as MLP, kNN and Random Forest with an accuracy of 65.3\%, 72.8\% and 93.4\% respectively. The critical comparison of the result indicates that the performance of Random Forest is better than MLP and kNN. This approach will be helpful in remote detection of human body movement of patients.},

Due to the complex nature of the radio environment, analytical models may not characterize the wireless channel, which makes the solution of these problems very difficult. Recently, cognitive network architectures using sophisticated learning techniques are increasingly being applied to such problems. In this paper, we propose data-driven machine learning (ML) schemes to efficiently solve these problems in wireless LAN (WLAN) networks. The proposed schemes are evaluated and results are compared with traditional approaches to the aforementioned problems. The results report significant improvement in network performance by applying the proposed schemes. The proposed scheme for handover prediction outperforms traditional methods i.e. received signal strength method and traveling distance method by reducing the number of unnecessary handovers by 60\% and 50\% respectively. Similarly, in AP selection, the proposed scheme outperforms the strongest signal first and least loaded first algorithms by achieving higher throughput gains up to 9.2\% and 8\% respectively.},

In WLAN, load balancing among Access Points (AP) is an important issue for efficient resource management or supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) of traffic, but most researches focused on the AP selection in network entry or roaming of Stations (STA). In this paper, we propose an AP-Initiated Flow Redirection (FR) for AP load balancing by monitoring APâs availability in the true sense. When the APâs resource becomes almost saturated, that is used more than a specific threshold, the AP queries the roaming possible neighbor APs about their availability and calculates the distribution of traffic load with statistical methods such as entropy or chi-square. Finally, the AP decides flows and new APs for redirection and performs it. Our simulation results show that our FR mechanism increases the performance in the various views.},

This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that are presented herein have great performance; however, instead of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networking (RNN) and show the improved performance.

	abstract = {Wireless local area networks (WLANs) empowered by IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) hold a dominant position in providing Internet access thanks to their freedom of deployment and configuration as well as the existence of affordable and highly interoperable devices. The Wi-Fi community is currently deploying Wi-Fi 6 and developing Wi-Fi 7, which will bring higher data rates, better multi-user and multi-AP support, and, most importantly, improved configuration flexibility. These technical innovations, including the plethora of configuration parameters, are making next-generation WLANs exceedingly complex as the dependencies between parameters and their joint optimization usually have a non-linear impact on network performance. The complexity is further increased in the case of dense deployments and coexistence in shared bands. 
				While classical optimization approaches fail in such conditions, machine learning (ML) is able to handle complexity. Much research has been published on using ML to improve Wi-Fi performance and solutions are slowly being adopted in existing deployments. In this survey, we adopt a structured approach to describe the various Wi-Fi areas where ML is applied. To this end, we analyze over 250 papers in the field, providing readers with an overview of the main trends. Based on this review, we identify specific open challenges and provide general future research directions.},

It also takes into account the effects of the pedestrian's previous status. A promotional experiment in a major shopping mall demonstrated that the highest prediction accuracy of the MMM method is 74.4\%. In comparison with methods based on a Markov-chain model (MM) and a hidden-Markov model (HMM) (i.e., prediction rates of about 45\% and 2\%, respectively), the proposed MMM-based prediction method is substantially more accurate. This pedestrian-movement prediction based on MMM using tracking data will make it possible to provide so-called "adaptive mobile services" with proactive functions.},

	abstract = {TCP throughput prediction is an important capability in wide area overlay and multi-homed networks where multiple paths may exist between data sources and receivers. In this paper we describe a new, lightweight method for TCP throughput prediction that can generate accurate forecasts for a broad range of file sizes and path conditions. Our method is based on Support Vector Regression modeling that uses a combination of prior file transfers and measurements of simple path properties. We calibrate and evaluate the capabilities of our throughput predictor in an extensive set of lab-based experiments where ground truth can be established for path properties using highly accurate passive measurements. We report the performance for our method in the ideal case of using our passive path property measurements over a range of test configurations. Our results show that for bulk transfers in heavy traffic, TCP throughput is predicted within 10\% of the actual value 87\% of the time, representing nearly a 3-fold improvement in accuracy over prior history-based methods. In the same lab environment, we assess our method using less accurate active probe measurements of path properties, and show that predictions can be made within 10\% of the actual value nearly 50\% of the time over a range of file sizes and traffic conditions. This result represents approximately a 60\% improvement over history-based methods with a much lower impact on end-to-end paths. Finally, we implement our predictor in a tool called PathPerf and test it in experiments conducted on wide area paths. The results demonstrate that PathPerf predicts TCP through put accurately over a variety of paths.},

Together with the moving-average (MA) model, it is a special case and key component of the more general autoregressiveâmoving-average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models of time series, which have a more complicated stochastic structure; it is also a special case of the vector autoregressive model (VAR), which consists of a system of more than one interlocking stochastic difference equation in more than one evolving random variable.
Contrary to the moving-average (MA) model, the autoregressive model is not always stationary as it may contain a unit root.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.  Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
A time series is very frequently plotted via a run chart (which is a temporal line chart). Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test relationships between one or more different time series, this type of analysis is not usually called "time series analysis", which refers in particular to relationships between different points in time within a single series.
Time series data have a natural temporal ordering.  This makes time series analysis distinct from cross-sectional studies, in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data could be entered in any order).  Time series analysis is also distinct from spatial data analysis where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A stochastic model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see time reversibility).
Time series analysis can be applied to real-valued, continuous data, discrete numeric data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the English language).},

	abstract = {Received signal strength (RSS) has been attractive for localization in wireless sensor network (WSN) for simplicity and cost. It is one of the simplest methods for ranging. However, in wireless communication channel, especially in indoor communication, the received signal is much fluctuated by multipath fading and shadowing problem. These causes make RSS measurement incur more errors and consequentially much faults in ranging. It results in low precision for location detection process. To be one of the methods to improve the limitation of RSS method, in this paper we propose using direction calibration to obtain better performance. Sequentially, a multilateration is the next step for carrying out the location of nodes. We also propose to use weighted least squares (WLS) method to solve the overdetermined problem in lateration with weighting matrix composed of reliability factors in conjunction with conventional RSS weighting. Our scheme has much improvement shown by simulation results.},

Owing to the dynamic changes in the wireless networks and the exponential growth of the IoT products, which make it difï¬cult to locate large quantities of users and devices, providing accurate tracking and trajectory predictions in open and highly condensed wireless networks is extremely difï¬cult. An adaptive and scalable system is required to offer accurate location-based services (LBSs) for the success of IoT. To enhance the attainment of IoT, we propose a hybrid of principal component analysis (PCA) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms for mobility predictions in a wireless urban area. During the system development processes, we ï¬rst collect an LTE signal from three unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs), the Wi-Fi signal strength from each reachable Wi-Fi access points (APs), and channel information from the Wi-Fi signal media. We then apply PCA to reduce the number of Wi-Fi features and to decrease signal noise. Next, we train the GRU algorithm to develop models that can predict the mobility of IoT device users. Finally, we evaluate the tracking and trajectory models. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we compare the common parameters of the GRU with those of other deep learning types. The proposed technique provides plausible and state-of-the-art results for mobility predictions of IoT devices in a wireless environment.},

Since the structure of the measured data changes in accordance with the number of connected base stations, it is necessary to work on data uniformity processing before running the deep learning network. Therefore, we extract only the case in which three base stations are connected, using it as a feature of deep learning network. The experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed algorithm is much better than that of the conventional fingerprint method.

	abstract = {In this paper, localization based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) is investigated assuming a path loss log normal shadowing model. On the one hand, indirect RSS-based estimation schemes are investigated; these schemes are based on two steps of estimation: estimation of ranges from RSS and then estimation of position using weighted least square approximation. We show that the performances of this type of schemes depend on the used estimator in the first step. We suggest that typical median estimator must be replaced by maximum likelihood estimator (mode) to enhance the positioning accuracy. On the other hand, a new direct RSS-based estimation scheme of position is proposed; Monte Carlo simulations show that the new estimator performs better than indirect estimators and can be reliable in future hybrid localization systems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a cost-effective localization method by using received signal strength (RSS) from single wireless access point (AP) that has only three directional antennas. To reduce the requirement for the costly database training process, a three-step parametric model-based approach is proposed. This approach estimates the AP-device angle, distance, and the device location analytically by making use of wireless path-loss models, antenna radiation patterns, and differential RSS. Meanwhile, the differential antenna gain is introduced to eliminate the need for known AP-device distances when estimating the AP-device angle. Furthermore, to circumvent the difficulty in detecting outliers in a single-AP system, this paper further integrates single-AP solutions with dead-reckoning (DR) to obtain more robust solutions. Three types of measurement models (i.e., the device location updates, AP-device angle updates, and AP-device distance updates) are built from the single-AP localization system. Static and dynamic field tests with the new Bluetooth 5 signals indicated the possibility for using RSS from three directional antennas on single AP to obtain a low-cost localization solution and the effectiveness of integrating with DR on mitigating the impact of outliers.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2106.04525},
	abstract = {The randomized or cross-validated split of training and testing sets has been adopted as the gold standard of machine learning for decades. The establishment of these split protocols are based on two assumptions: (i)-fixing the dataset to be eternally static so we could evaluate different machine learning algorithms or models; (ii)-there is a complete set of annotated data available to researchers or industrial practitioners. However, in this article, we intend to take a closer and critical look at the split protocol itself and point out its weakness and limitation, especially for industrial applications. In many real-world problems, we must acknowledge that there are numerous situations where assumption (ii) does not hold. For instance, for interdisciplinary applications like drug discovery, it often requires real lab experiments to annotate data which poses huge costs in both time and financial considerations. In other words, it can be very difficult or even impossible to satisfy assumption (ii). In this article, we intend to access this problem and reiterate the paradigm of active learning, and investigate its potential on solving problems under unconventional train/test split protocols. We further propose a new adaptive active learning architecture (AAL) which involves an adaptation policy, in comparison with the traditional active learning that only unidirectionally adds data points to the training pool. We primarily justify our points by extensively investigating an interdisciplinary drug-protein binding problem. We additionally evaluate AAL on more conventional machine learning benchmarking datasets like CIFAR-10 to demonstrate the generalizability and efficacy of the new framework.},
