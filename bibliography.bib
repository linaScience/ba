	abstract = {Nowadays we are assisting to a noticeable proliferation of new generation smart-phones, as well as to the growth of mobile applications development. We are fairly surrounded by a huge number of proactive applications, which automatically provide users with relevant information exactly at the right time and at the right place when they need it. This ability is generally given by the exploitation of context information, and mainly Location Information. However, a location service running onto a smartphone has to deal with a great challenge, which is to manage the trade-off between the service's resources usage and its accuracy. In my work I investigate efficient localization strategies: these include, in addition to the standard location tracking techniques, the support of other technologies already available on mobile phones (i.e., sensors), as well as the integration of either Human Mobility Modelling and Machine Learning techniques. The main purposes of this work are: to reduce the impact that the service has on the device's resources usage in the case of continuous localization; to preserve the privacy of the user by running the whole system on the mobile device without relying on a back-end server; and to offer an ubiquitous coverage.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, 16.7 million people die each year due to cardiovascular disease. These statistics raise demand of devices like sensor-based pacemakers (PM) which are not just doing heart rate augmentation but also capable to transmit information via wireless link to on body sensor and support remote monitoring of such patients. As per the world health organization WHO reports there are more than 3 million functioning PMs and about 600,000 pacemakers are implanted each year in world. On an average, 70‚Äì80\% of PMs are implanted in aged patients around 65¬†years or older. In addition to continuous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters, detection of physical movement of such patients may be helpful to assess their well-being. This paper has been formulated with an aim to highlight an approach which may be used to detect the physical movement of the patient using information signal received from implanted PM. The transmitted signal will experience a pathloss offered by wireless human body channel, which will affect the link quality parameters namely Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In the current work mathematical model has been formulated considering in body and on body channel propagation conditions and received power, received energy, pathloss, SNR, BER, bit rate, energy per bit and RSSI have been evaluated using IEEE802.15.6 channel models CM2 and CM3. Data set has been created and human body movement has been detected using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Prediction accuracy of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbours¬†(kNN) and Random Forest have been compared. The analysis performed depicts that human body movement can be detected using different channel models and ML techniques such as MLP, kNN and Random Forest with an accuracy of 65.3\%, 72.8\% and 93.4\% respectively. The critical comparison of the result indicates that the performance of Random Forest is better than MLP and kNN. This approach will be helpful in remote detection of human body movement of patients.},

	abstract = {Device mobility in dense Wi-Fi networks offers several challenges. Two well-known problems related to device mobility are handover prediction and access point selection. Due to the complex nature of the radio environment, analytical models may not characterize the wireless channel, which makes the solution of these problems very difficult. Recently, cognitive network architectures using sophisticated learning techniques are increasingly being applied to such problems. In this paper, we propose data-driven machine learning (ML) schemes to efficiently solve these problems in wireless LAN (WLAN) networks. The proposed schemes are evaluated and results are compared with traditional approaches to the aforementioned problems. The results report significant improvement in network performance by applying the proposed schemes. The proposed scheme for handover prediction outperforms traditional methods i.e. received signal strength method and traveling distance method by reducing the number of unnecessary handovers by 60\% and 50\% respectively. Similarly, in AP selection, the proposed scheme outperforms the strongest signal first and least loaded first algorithms by achieving higher throughput gains up to 9.2\% and 8\% respectively.},

In WLAN, load balancing among Access Points (AP) is an important issue for efficient resource management or supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) of traffic, but most researches focused on the AP selection in network entry or roaming of Stations (STA). In this paper, we propose an AP-Initiated Flow Redirection (FR) for AP load balancing by monitoring AP‚Äôs availability in the true sense. When the AP‚Äôs resource becomes almost saturated, that is used more than a specific threshold, the AP queries the roaming possible neighbor APs about their availability and calculates the distribution of traffic load with statistical methods such as entropy or chi-square. Finally, the AP decides flows and new APs for redirection and performs it. Our simulation results show that our FR mechanism increases the performance in the various views.},

The movement of the human body parts cause changes in the wireless signal reflections, which result in variations in the CSI. By analyzing the data streams of CSIs for different activities and comparing them against stored models, human behavior can be recognized. This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that are presented herein have great performance; however, instead of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networking (RNN) and show the improved performance. We also discuss different challenges such as environment change, frame rate selection, and the multi-user scenario; and finally suggest possible directions for future work.},

The Wi-Fi community is currently deploying Wi-Fi 6 and developing Wi-Fi 7, which will bring higher data rates, better multi-user and multi-AP support, and, most importantly, improved configuration flexibility. These technical innovations, including the plethora of configuration parameters, are making next-generation WLANs exceedingly complex as the dependencies between parameters and their joint optimization usually have a non-linear impact on network performance. The complexity is further increased in the case of dense deployments and coexistence in shared bands. While classical optimization approaches fail in such conditions, machine learning (ML) is able to handle complexity. Much research has been published on using ML to improve Wi-Fi performance and solutions are slowly being adopted in existing deployments. In this survey, we adopt a structured approach to describe the various Wi-Fi areas where ML is applied. To this end, we analyze over 250 papers in the field, providing readers with an overview of the main trends. Based on this review, we identify specific open challenges and provide general future research directions.},

It also takes into account the effects of the pedestrian's previous status. A promotional experiment in a major shopping mall demonstrated that the highest prediction accuracy of the MMM method is 74.4\%. In comparison with methods based on a Markov-chain model (MM) and a hidden-Markov model (HMM) (i.e., prediction rates of about 45\% and 2\%, respectively), the proposed MMM-based prediction method is substantially more accurate. This pedestrian-movement prediction based on MMM using tracking data will make it possible to provide so-called "adaptive mobile services" with proactive functions.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a channel state information (CSI)-based prediction method of a human flow that includes activity. The objective of the paper is to predict a human flow in an outdoor road. This human flow prediction is useful for the prediction of the number of passing people and their activity without privacy issues as a result of the absence of any camera systems. In this paper, we assume seven types of activities: one, two, and three people walking; one, two, and three people running; and one person cycling. Since the CSI can effectively express the effect of multipath fading in wireless signals, we expected the CSI to predict the various activities. In our proposed method, the amplitude and phase components are extracted from the measured CSI. The feature values for machine learning are the mean and variance of the maximum eigenvalue derived from the auto-correlation matrix and variance‚Äìcovariance matrix composed of the amplitude or phase components and the passing time of flow. Using these feature values, we evaluated the prediction accuracy by leave-one-out cross-validation with a linear support vector machine (SVM). As a result, the proposed method achieved the maximum prediction accuracy of 100\% for each direction and 99.5\% for two directions.},

With its promising classification performance, DBN-TSK-FC features sharing both the powerful neural representation ability of a DBN and the strong uncertainty-handling capability of an interpretable fuzzy representation. On the one hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its interpretable fuzzy representation in a hierarchical way by applying the classical fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM to obtain fuzzy partitions on the training dataset. Then, it forms interpretable antecedent parts of fuzzy rules as the corresponding fuzzy representation. On the other hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its DBN-based neural representation in the other hierarchical way. That is, it applies the existing unsupervised DBN pretraining on the training dataset and then takes the neural representation of all the hidden nodes in the top layer of the corresponding DBN as the set of consequent variables of fuzzy rules. In this approach, both the interpretable fuzzy representation and the DBN-based neural representation are further fused to form the corresponding fuzzy rules quickly by using the least learning machine (LLM) on both the fuzzy rules and the labeling information of the original dataset. Therefore, DBN-TSK-FC is essentially a deep TSK fuzzy classifier from the perspective of fuzzy rules, and it indeed avoids the very slow fine-tuning training required after the unsupervised pretraining of the existing DBN learning. The experimental results on the MovementAAL\_RSS dataset indicate the effectiveness of the proposed classifier DBN-TSK-FC.},

In this paper we describe a new, lightweight method for TCP throughput prediction that can generate accurate forecasts for a broad range of file sizes and path conditions. Our method is based on Support Vector Regression modeling that uses a combination of prior file transfers and measurements of simple path properties. We calibrate and evaluate the capabilities of our throughput predictor in an extensive set of lab-based experiments where ground truth can be established for path properties using highly accurate passive measurements. We report the performance for our method in the ideal case of using our passive path property measurements over a range of test configurations. Our results show that for bulk transfers in heavy traffic, TCP throughput is predicted within 10\% of the actual value 87\% of the time, representing nearly a 3-fold improvement in accuracy over prior history-based methods. In the same lab environment, we assess our method using less accurate active probe measurements of path properties, and show that predictions can be made within 10\% of the actual value nearly 50\% of the time over a range of file sizes and traffic conditions. This result represents approximately a 60\% improvement over history-based methods with a much lower impact on end-to-end paths. Finally, we implement our predictor in a tool called PathPerf and test it in experiments conducted on wide area paths. The results demonstrate that PathPerf predicts TCP through put accurately over a variety of paths.},

Modern networks, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, become more decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to make decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of network environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable the network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or actions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small. However, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are usually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the optimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, DRL, a combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed to overcome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of DRL from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we review DRL approaches proposed to address emerging issues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network access, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security, and connectivity preservation which are all important to next generation networks, such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we present applications of DRL for traffic routing, resource sharing, and data collection. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of applying DRL.},

This can be useful either to increase the flexibility of comfort systems or, in the more interesting case, to detect potentially dangerous situations as early as possible. In this contribution, a novel approach for trajectory prediction is proposed which has the capability to predict the vehicle's trajectory several seconds in advance, the so called long-term prediction. To achieve this, previously observed motion patterns are used to infer a joint probability distribution as motion model. Using this distribution, a trajectory can be predicted by calculating the probability for the future motion, conditioned on the current observed history motion pattern. The advantage of the probabilistic modeling is that the result is not only a prediction, but rather a whole distribution over the future trajectories and a specific prediction can be made by the evaluation of the statistical properties, e.g. the mean of this conditioned distribution. Additionally, an evaluation of the variance can be used to examine the reliability of the prediction.},

Towards this goal, we propose a generic framework to approach the problem of mobility prediction using hidden Markov models (HMM). This method can be used to model hidden parameters in the models. We propose a way to extract user movement information from a real dataset, train a HMM using this data and make predictions using the HMM. This model can successfully predict long sequences of a mobile user's path from observed sequences and also uses successive sequences of observed data to train its learning parameters to enhance prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we show that this model is very generic and can be suited to make predictions using the same information from the perspective of the access point or the mobile node.},

In this paper, we address these issues and present a robust prediction model for real-life mobile phone data of individual users, in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. In our robust model, we first effectively identify and eliminate the noisy instances from the training dataset by determining a dynamic noise threshold using naive Bayes classifier and laplace estimator, which may differ from user-to-user according to their unique behavioral patterns. After that, we employ the most popular rule-based machine learning classification technique, i.e., decision tree, on the noise-free quality dataset to build the prediction model. Experimental results on the real-life mobile phone datasets (e.g., phone call log) of individual mobile phone users, show the effectiveness of our robust model in terms of precision, recall and f-measure.},

Attenuation constant varies according to indoor environment. For this reason, the attenuation constant is determined before estimating the position of target node in the conventional method. We propose a position estimation method that estimates a target node position and attenuation constant simultaneously. Thus, the proposed method has no need to estimate the attenuation constant in the target environment preliminarily. To evaluate the position estimation accuracy of the proposed method, we developed the prototype system and experimented in our office. Multiple fixed target nodes were set in the target environment. The experiment presents that the proposed method has about the same accuracy as the conventional one without preliminary data collection for attenuation constant estimation.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.  Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
A time series is very frequently plotted via a run chart (which is a temporal line chart). Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test relationships between one or more different time series, this type of analysis is not usually called "time series analysis", which refers in particular to relationships between different points in time within a single series.
Time series data have a natural temporal ordering.  This makes time series analysis distinct from cross-sectional studies, in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data could be entered in any order).  Time series analysis is also distinct from spatial data analysis where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A stochastic model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see time reversibility).
Time series analysis can be applied to real-valued, continuous data, discrete numeric data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the English language).},

	abstract = {Existing analyses of optimization in deep learning are either continuous, focusing on (variants of) gradient Ô¨Çow, or discrete, directly treating (variants of) gradient descent. Gradient Ô¨Çow is amenable to theoretical analysis, but is stylized and disregards computational efÔ¨Åciency. The extent to which it represents gradient descent is an open question in the theory of deep learning. The current paper studies this question. Viewing gradient descent as an approximate numerical solution to the initial value problem of gradient Ô¨Çow, we Ô¨Ånd that the degree of approximation depends on the curvature around the gradient Ô¨Çow trajectory. We then show that over deep neural networks with homogeneous activations, gradient Ô¨Çow trajectories enjoy favorable curvature, suggesting they are well approximated by gradient descent. This Ô¨Ånding allows us to translate an analysis of gradient Ô¨Çow over deep linear neural networks into a guarantee that gradient descent efÔ¨Åciently converges to global minimum almost surely under random initialization. Experiments suggest that over simple deep neural networks, gradient descent with conventional step size is indeed close to gradient Ô¨Çow. We hypothesize that the theory of gradient Ô¨Çows will unravel mysteries behind deep learning.},

Their applications include real-time tracking, activity recognition, health care, navigation, emergence detection, and target-of-interest monitoring, among others.

Since people spend most of their time in indoor environments, indoor tracking service is in great public demand. Based on this observation, this paper aims to provide a better understanding of state-of-the-art technologies and stimulate new research efforts in this field. For these purposes, existing localization technologies that can be used for tracking individuals in indoor environments are reviewed, along with some further discussions.},

	abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of human motion prediction, consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences. State-of-the-art approaches provide good results, however, they rely on deep learning architectures of arbitrary complexity, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers or Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), typically requiring multiple training stages and more than 2 million parameters. In this paper, we show that, after combining with a series of standard practices, such as applying Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), predicting residual displacement of joints and optimizing velocity as an auxiliary loss, a light-weight network based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with only 0.14 million parameters can surpass the state-of-the-art performance. An exhaustive evaluation on the Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW datasets shows that our method, named SIMLPE, consistently outperforms all other approaches. We hope that our simple method could serve as a strong baseline for the community and allow re-thinking of the human motion prediction problem.

However, in wireless communication channel, especially in indoor communication, the received signal is much fluctuated by multipath fading and shadowing problem. These causes make RSS measurement incur more errors and consequentially much faults in ranging. It results in low precision for location detection process. To be one of the methods to improve the limitation of RSS method, in this paper we propose using direction calibration to obtain better performance. Sequentially, a multilateration is the next step for carrying out the location of nodes. We also propose to use weighted least squares (WLS) method to solve the overdetermined problem in lateration with weighting matrix composed of reliability factors in conjunction with conventional RSS weighting. Our scheme has much improvement shown by simulation results.},

Owing to the dynamic changes in the wireless networks and the exponential growth of the IoT products, which make it difÔ¨Åcult to locate large quantities of users and devices, providing accurate tracking and trajectory predictions in open and highly condensed wireless networks is extremely difÔ¨Åcult. An adaptive and scalable system is required to offer accurate location-based services (LBSs) for the success of IoT. To enhance the attainment of IoT, we propose a hybrid of principal component analysis (PCA) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms for mobility predictions in a wireless urban area. During the system development processes, we Ô¨Årst collect an LTE signal from three unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs), the Wi-Fi signal strength from each reachable Wi-Fi access points (APs), and channel information from the Wi-Fi signal media. We then apply PCA to reduce the number of Wi-Fi features and to decrease signal noise. Next, we train the GRU algorithm to develop models that can predict the mobility of IoT device users. Finally, we evaluate the tracking and trajectory models. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we compare the common parameters of the GRU with those of other deep learning types. The proposed technique provides plausible and state-of-the-art results for mobility predictions of IoT devices in a wireless environment.},

We show that the performances of this type of schemes depend on the used estimator in the first step. We suggest that typical median estimator must be replaced by maximum likelihood estimator (mode) to enhance the positioning accuracy. On the other hand, a new direct RSS-based estimation scheme of position is proposed; Monte Carlo simulations show that the new estimator performs better than indirect estimators and can be reliable in future hybrid localization systems.},

To reduce the requirement for the costly database training process, a three-step parametric model-based approach is proposed. This approach estimates the AP-device angle, distance, and the device location analytically by making use of wireless path-loss models, antenna radiation patterns, and differential RSS. Meanwhile, the differential antenna gain is introduced to eliminate the need for known AP-device distances when estimating the AP-device angle. Furthermore, to circumvent the difficulty in detecting outliers in a single-AP system, this paper further integrates single-AP solutions with dead-reckoning (DR) to obtain more robust solutions. Three types of measurement models (i.e., the device location updates, AP-device angle updates, and AP-device distance updates) are built from the single-AP localization system. Static and dynamic field tests with the new Bluetooth 5 signals indicated the possibility for using RSS from three directional antennas on single AP to obtain a low-cost localization solution and the effectiveness of integrating with DR on mitigating the impact of outliers.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2106.04525},
	abstract = {The randomized or cross-validated split of training and testing sets has been adopted as the gold standard of machine learning for decades. The establishment of these split protocols are based on two assumptions: (i)-fixing the dataset to be eternally static so we could evaluate different machine learning algorithms or models; (ii)-there is a complete set of annotated data available to researchers or industrial practitioners. However, in this article, we intend to take a closer and critical look at the split protocol itself and point out its weakness and limitation, especially for industrial applications. In many real-world problems, we must acknowledge that there are numerous situations where assumption (ii) does not hold. For instance, for interdisciplinary applications like drug discovery, it often requires real lab experiments to annotate data which poses huge costs in both time and financial considerations. In other words, it can be very difficult or even impossible to satisfy assumption (ii). In this article, we intend to access this problem and reiterate the paradigm of active learning, and investigate its potential on solving problems under unconventional train/test split protocols. We further propose a new adaptive active learning architecture (AAL) which involves an adaptation policy, in comparison with the traditional active learning that only unidirectionally adds data points to the training pool.

	abstract = {Although Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fingerprinting localization has become a hot research topic with encouraging results, it is difficult to predict the location depending on a short duration received signal strength indication (RSSI) sequence in realistic scenarios due to the severe fluctuation of RSSI. We introduce a new perspective to view the indoor positioning problem by radio map fingerprint. We argue that even though beacons may be independently deployed, the RSSI series bear certain spatial relation because of their copresence in the same physical space. The latent relation implicitly conveyed by the coexistence of their signals at various indoor locations. Unlike existing approaches that try to find a direct mapping between sensed signals and the corresponding location, we explore the spatial relation of beacons from the input data to estimate location. We propose a deep learning localization system, termed DRVAT, which is based on the distributed representation vector (DRV) and self-attention (AT) among the pairs of MAC-RSSI. First, we obtain DRVs which represent dense features in low dimensionality through pre-training on all MAC-RSSIs. Then we exploit self-attention mechanism to learn the latent spatial relation of beacons. Finally, MAC-RSSIs labeled with locations are used to fine-tune the model for estimating location. Localization accuracy results demonstrated the superior performance as compared with other positioning methods, and the visualization of DRV and attention mechanism are consistent with the spatial deployment of BLE.},

	abstract = {Learning the right representations from complex input data is the key ability of successful machine learning (ML) models. The latter are often tailored to a specific data modality. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were designed having sequential data in mind, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were designed to exploit spatial correlation in images. Unlike computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), each of which targets a single well-defined modality, network ML problems often have a mixture of data modalities as input. Yet, instead of exploiting such abundance, practitioners tend to rely on sub-features thereof, reducing the problem to single modality for the sake of simplicity. In this paper, we advocate for exploiting all the modalities naturally present in network data. As a first step, we observe that network data systematically exhibits a mixture of quantities (e.g., measurements), and entities (e.g., IP addresses, names, etc.). Whereas the former are generally well exploited, the latter are often underused or poorly represented (e.g., with one-hot encoding). We propose to systematically leverage language models to learn entity representations, whenever significant sequences of such entities are historically observed. Through two diverse use-cases, we show that such entity encoding can benefit and naturally augment classic quantity-based features.},
